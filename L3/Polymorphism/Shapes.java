// ðŸ§  Late Binding (Run-Time Polymorphism)
// Also called dynamic binding.
// Happens at runtime.
// The method call is resolved based on the actual object's type, not the reference type.

// Main class moved to Main.java
// Here, even though a is of type Animal, the JVM waits until runtime to determine the actual method to call â€” based on the fact that it points to a Dog object.
